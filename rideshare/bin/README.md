# Traing Wheels : Ride sharing app

**Training Wheels** is a ride sharing application for Revature associates. All associates can log in via Slack and submit requests to organize travel plans with their co-workers. A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account and submit a ride offer. Offers consist of a departure time, a starting location, and a destination. Any associates who need a ride can coordinate with drivers who have made an offer via Training Wheels.

Administrators can view a list of all rides that have occurred, add and remove points of interest (specific locations where users can travel to or from), and view a list of all users.

A Slack integration is available that allows power users to create offers and requests from within Slack.
